## PROJECT
### A Comparative Analysis of Time Series Forecasting Models for Predicting Stock Prices in the Vietnamese Real Estate Sector
#### Abstract
Vietnam's real estate market serves as a critical pillar of the nation's economy. Understanding stock price movements of leading companies within this sector is therefore crucial for informed investment decisions. This study applies several time series analysis techniques to explore forecasting models, including Linear Regression, ARIMA, RNN, GRU, LSTM, VARMA, Fuzzy time series, XGBoost, FEDformer, and DLinear. By training forecasting models on historical stock price data, this study compares their effectiveness in predicting the stock prices of Vietnamese real estate corporations. The evaluation will utilize three key metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
#### Dataset
This study examines the historical stock prices of three leading real estate companies in Vietnam: Novaland Group (NVL), Khang Dien House (KDH), and Dat Xanh Group (DXG), taken from [investing.com](https://investing.com). The data will cover the period from March 1, 2017 to June 1, 2024.
#### Models
The 10 following models are implemented and evaluated in this project:
- Linear Regression
- ARIMA
- RNN
- GRU
- LSTM
- VARMA
- Fuzzy time series
- XGBoost
- FEDFormer
- DLinear
### Evaluation
The models are evaluated using various performance metrics, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). Three different train-test split ratios are used for each model: 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10.
